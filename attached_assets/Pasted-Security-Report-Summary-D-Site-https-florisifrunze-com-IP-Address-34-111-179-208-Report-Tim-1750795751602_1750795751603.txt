Your site could be at risk, letâ€™s perform a deeper security analysis of your site and APIs:	
Missing Headers
Content-Security-Policy	Content Security Policy is an effective measure to protect your site from XSS attacks. By whitelisting sources of approved content, you can prevent the browser from loading malicious assets.
X-Frame-Options	X-Frame-Options tells the browser whether you want to allow your site to be framed or not. By preventing a browser from framing your site you can defend against attacks like clickjacking. Recommended value "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN".
X-Content-Type-Options	X-Content-Type-Options stops a browser from trying to MIME-sniff the content type and forces it to stick with the declared content-type. The only valid value for this header is "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff".
Referrer-Policy	Referrer Policy is a new header that allows a site to control how much information the browser includes with navigations away from a document and should be set by all sites.
Permissions-Policy	Permissions Policy is a new header that allows a site to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser.
