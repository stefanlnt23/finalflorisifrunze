Form Design & Usability

Add form validation styling: Show clear error states for required fields and invalid inputs
Improve field labels: Consider floating labels or better placeholder text that doesn't disappear
Add success confirmation: Show a clear success message after form submission
Include CAPTCHA/spam protection: Add basic bot protection for the contact form

Visual Hierarchy & Layout

Balance the two-column layout: The left form section feels cramped compared to the spacious contact info on the right
Improve contact info design: The right side contact details could be more visually appealing with:

Better icon styling (larger, more colorful)
Card-like containers for each contact method
More prominent phone number and email



Content & Information

Add response time expectations: Tell users when they can expect a reply (e.g., "We respond within 24 hours")
Include business hours more prominently: Move the working hours higher up or make them more visible
Add service area information: Mention which areas you serve for landscape services

Map Integration

Interactive map improvements:

Add a custom marker for your business location
Include a "Get Directions" button
Consider showing your service radius on the map



Trust & Social Proof

Add testimonial snippet: Include a brief client quote or rating near the contact form
Emergency contact option: For urgent landscape issues, consider adding an emergency contact method
Social media integration: Make the social icons more prominent and add Instagram (visual business)

Mobile Optimization

Stack layout properly: Ensure the form and contact info stack well on mobile
Larger touch targets: Make sure all clickable elements are finger-friendly
Simplified mobile map: Consider a static map image on mobile with link to open in maps app

Call-to-Action Enhancement

Multiple contact methods: Add quick action buttons like "Call Now" or "WhatsApp Us"
Scheduling integration: Consider adding a "Schedule Consultation" button that links to a calendar booking system
